          <div id = "health_section" class = "padding highlight">
            <h5>Healthcare Availability</h5>
            <p >As may be expected, states with lower percentages of residents lacking healthcare tend to see lower
              percentages of <strong>obesity</strong>. For example,
              Massachusetts has the lowest percentage of residents lacking healthcare, and also has one of the lowest
              percentages of obesity across the United States.
              On the other hand, Texas has the highest percentage of residents lacking healthcare and also has one of
              the
              highest percentages of obesity in the country. </p>

            <p>It can be seen that having access to healthcare does not seem to affect the percentage of residents that
              <strong>smoke</strong>. Massachusetts and Texas appear of opposite
              ends of the spectrum when it comes to residents having heathcare. However, the percentage of residents
              that
              smoke is almost the same. It seems most of the country
              shows residents that smoke to be approximately 18%. Some of the higher smoker percentages come from states
              with higher percentages of residents lacking healthcare (Between
              14-20%). However, the 2 highest smoker percentages come from 2 states with relatively good access to
              healthcare (West Virginia and Kentucky).
            </p>

            <p>There appears to be a fairly strong correlation across the country that states with higher
              <strong>poverty</strong> rates
              also tend to have greater percentages
              of residents lacking healthcare. This is an unfortunate reality, as those that live in poverty may not be
              able to afford healthcare.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id = "income_section" class = "padding">
            <h5>Household Income Correlations</h5>
            <p>There seems to be a downward trend across states when it comes to <strong>obesity</strong> percentage and
              median household income. This indicates that,
              as household income increases, the percentage of obesity decreases.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, there also appears to be a downward trend when looking at <strong>smoking</strong>
              percentage and median household income. As median household
              income increases, the smoking percentage decreases. However, this trend appears to flatten around an
              income
              of $55,000, showing smoking percentage
              of approximately 15%. This plateau stays consistent through the higher incomes available in this study.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, as expected, the percetange of residents in <strong>poverty</strong> appears to be inversely
              proportional with median household income. Washington DC
              is an interesting outlier, in that it has a median household income on the higher end of the spectrum, but
              also a high percentage of residents in poverty. </p>
          </div>
          <div id = "age_section" class = "padding">
            <h5>Age Correlations</h5>
            <p>When looking at age across the US, there does not seem to be an obvious correlation to
              <strong>obesity</strong> percentage. </p>
            <p>When comparing states with lower median age to states with higher median age, it can be seen there is
              also not a significant trend when looking at <strong>smoking</strong> either. However
              Utah (with a low median age and low smoking percentage) and West Virginia (with a high median age and high
              smoking percentage) do appear to skew this particular
              graph to appear as though states with lower median age also have lower smoking percentages.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, there does not seem to be a particular correlation of age and <strong>poverty</strong>.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to see that Utah's median age is much lower than every other state, making it appear as
              an outlier in these comparisons.</p>
